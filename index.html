		<p>In my opinion, J. Cole is the best rapper in the game today. J. Cole raps about events in his life that happened to him, he raps about his family, friends, fans, and things that are relatable. J. Cole always keeps it real and spits the truth. Cole has also been known as an outstanding lyricists, writing his own raps, and producing his own music. However, actions speak louder than words, let get into his awards.</p>

		<p>J Cole has been nominated for multiple awards including: Top Rap Album, Top Rap Atist, Producer of the Year, and many more. He won Album of the Year in 2014, for his album Forest Hills Drive. These are my reasons as to why J. Cole is the best rapper today.</p>

		<p>Kendrick is the best rapper this generation because he's created incredible albums that's recieved perfect scores. His music isn't the typical rap music because he is really conscious about his work. He makes bold moves in his music by talking about political situations that the average listener might miss. His album "To Pimp a Butterfly" has won multiple album of the year awards.</p>

		<p>His most recent album "DAMN." is his most commercialized album with over 1.2 million sells in one year. It's no denying that Kendrick has never released a dissapointing or bad album up to today which is impressive for somebody that's been around since his time. These are my reasons to why Kendrick Lamar is the best rap artist of this generation and will live on to being a legend.</p>
